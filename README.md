# Airbrakes
This is the repository we use to keep track of all the code we are writing for the Wolf-works Experimental Airbrakes.

The primary device we are using for data collection is the Parker-LORD 3DMCX5-AR. The [MicroStrain Communication Library](https://lord-microstrain.github.io/MSCL/Documentation/Getting%20Started/index.html?python#introduction) provides information on how to interact with sensors developed by LORD Sensing. MSCL has language bindings in C++, .NET (C#, VB, LabView, MATLAB), and Python, we will primarily be using Python for the airbrake code.

Here is the [MSCL Github Repository](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/MSCL) needed to interact with MSCL.
